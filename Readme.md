## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/navneetshahi14/Ecommerce-FullStack-Project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Ecommerce-FullStack-Project
   ```

3. Install dependencies for both client and server:
   ```bash
   # Install server dependencies
   cd ecombackend
   npm install

   # Install client user dependencies
   cd ../ecommerceuser
   npm install

   # Install client admin dependencies
   cd ../ecommerceadmin
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the `backend` with the following environment variables:
   ```env
   NODE_ENV=development
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

5. Run the server and client:
   ```bash
   # Run the server
   cd ecombackend
   npm run dev

   # Run the client user
   cd ../ecommerceuser
   npm start
   
   # Run the client admin
   cd ../ecommerceadmin
   npm start
   ```

6. The app should now be running locally on `http://localhost:3000` for the frontend and `http://localhost:5000` for the backend.
